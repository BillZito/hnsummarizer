I was born in South Africa and moved to California just before the start of high school, graduating from the University of California, San Diego in 2007 before working a corporate job in DC that ultimately landed me a sweet gig at Google.  My responsibility once there was to figure out how much to pay the company's executives, which meant I was lucky to enjoy face time with many of the top brass.,One of the biggest frustrations of running my music blog was that by the time I took it full-time, I was receiving upwards of 300 email pitches a day from artists, record labels, and publicists, all looking to have their music featured on Indie Shuffle.,Then, toward the end of last year, I decided that a good way to learn some new coding languages would be to try and solve this problem by developing a website to streamline the process.,I suppose in that sense I was lucky: I was already "part of the problem", and therefore had a good understanding of what was needed to "solve" it.,The value was clear: whereas before they were shooting their emails into an empty void from which they heard no response, they were now getting a response every single time they reached us.  I always knew I was sitting on a great source of users with the ~300 daily emails, and sure enough, as soon as I started pointing them to SubmitHub they latched on.,Where a traditional publicist can cost thousands of dollars, musicians were now able to reach a blog like Indie Shuffle and get an actual, human response for only $1 .,I've recently brought on someone to help run the company's financials , and one of his first questions was around increasing the cost of credits with an eye for increased earnings.
