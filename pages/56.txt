Lately I've been working for Voxygen, where I had the opportunity to develop a system to generate a live word cloud, based on the most frequent words pronounced by the guest of a political show.,Usually, for my business projects, I'm using Python/Flask for my backends and Mithril.js for my frontends.  I've been writing Elm and Phoenix code in my side projects for only 3 months.,But I knew that it was potentially something that would need a lot of live/websockets connections in a near future.
