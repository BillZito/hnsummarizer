I taught myself for a while and then took a course from my then co-worker, and now world renowned author, Tony Hillerson.,I’ve done co-location work for it, built Android apps alongside iOS implementations, ported apps to Android from iOS, and even found time to create my very own app for the Google Play Store.,While it’s not true, and I have confidence in both, that feeling comes from the fact that I can only be half-engaged in each community.  Over the last couple of years, the unsettling feeling that I’m becoming a mediocre developer for each platform has crept over me.,Sure, if I’m lacking work, I have two avenues to find more, but it’s not feasible for me to do both platforms for one client.,When you’re switching between platforms as a developer you’re trying to get your frame of mind right and it depresses your willingness to check out a new way of doing things.  I spent the first 3 months of 2016 on an Android project with a team using newer programming paradigms I’d not yet experienced such as RxJava.,Genymotion came along and made emulation better for a while, but recently even that became unusable with newer gradle versions and Instant Run.
