We didn’t used the Repo authoritative mode with better performance because it implied that we had to change our release process to build the bytecode file and we had some dynamic configurations exported by zkfarmer in PHP.  HHVM has a short release cycle, which is great to quickly correct problems. They accept easily pull requests if you explain what you’ve done and write a unit tests for what you changed.
