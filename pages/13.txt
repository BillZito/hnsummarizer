But while the title might say "Chief Technology Officer," it is probably just a fancy acronym for an "overworked developer." This is then about how to realize what the position needs and how to get there. It’s easy to accidentally become a CTO by getting hired by a small company with no other developers, like you would see in most startups.,Everything is built on technology, from retail ecommerce to mobile apps and it all benefits greatly when someone inside is pushing the technology to make it greater.,I’ve sat in a few roundtables with fellow CTOs and the majority of the discussions were about how to get the other parts of the company to respect the development processes.  I’d say "This is the direction we are going and this is how it’s going to work." In short, whatever the CTO says, that’s how it is going to be.  If a CTO doesn’t have that sort of power for technical decisions, they are not a CTO, but more of a lead engineer, in a suit.,Any meeting is a discussion on the direction the business is going and how technology can help with that, or sometimes how technology can create new opportunities for growth.  It’s not the right job if you hate meetings, dealing with non-technical people and think that all managers sit all day and do nothing.,I’ve done interviews with future CTO candidates where they would ask‚ "Why are you stuck with this old version, why haven’t you rewritten it with React.js?" Sorry to burst your bubble, but that’s not a great idea.,I’d like to believe that this is a stepping stone to becoming a CTO - not caring about these sort of things, not overly focusing on technical details but instead looking out for the team and everything else on top of that.,Becoming a CTO is about realizing the bigger picture of technological impact, which is how it defines the business and how it helps the customer.
