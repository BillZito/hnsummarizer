Michael Arnold has been quoted as saying that this is "a critical advance toward exploiting carbon nanotubes in logic, high-speed communications, and other semiconductor electronics technologies." According to him, CNTs finally outpacing silicon has been a major goal for nanotechnology for 20 years.  Carbon nanotube transistors was developed by the team back in 2014 and was used to deposit arrays of aligned semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes at high deposition velocity with exemplary control of placement and quantity.  Using the data from single CNT assessment, the researchers hypothesized that the new transistor will be capable of functioning five times faster with potential to become five times more efficient than current silicon transistors.
