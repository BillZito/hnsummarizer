Not only that, we also wanted our engineers to be able to easily deploy applications to our servers without having to set up a Chef recipe — like the role Heroku plays in many of our client projects.  Given our rather modest requirements it may seem obvious that our first attempt at deployment automation, Chef, was a bit overkill for our needs.,However, a primary goal of our solution was to automate the process of going from code in a repository to a deployed application in our cluster — much like Heroku.,After researching several potential solutions, we tried a number of different options, but nothing seemed to fit our scale or use cases as well as we had hoped.,We first attempted Openshift, which recommended a minimum configuration of far more and larger servers than were cost effective for the type of solution we wanted to create.
