FlexJSâ„¢ is the name for a next-generation Flex SDK that has the goal of allowing applications developed in MXML and ActionScript to not only run in the Flash/AIR runtimes, but also to run natively in the browser without Flash, on mobile devices as a PhoneGap/Cordova application, and in embedded JS environments such as Chromium Embedded Framework.,While Flash is expected to run in browsers that run on computers with traditional keyboards for years to come, existing Flex customers are finding that they want their applications to run in places that Flash/AIR will not run because some of their end users are now allowed to use devices like tablets as their only computer.,JavaScript has some 'compilers' that try to catch things like that, but once you start using Object or other low-level base classes like EventDispatcher, you can easily cause the compiler to lose track of the actual API parameters involved and not find out until too late.,Instead, those furniture kits come with custom connectors that only fit into certain holes and in the instructions have diagrams. Semi-Structured languages like ActionScript allow you to establish custom connectors so that the components can only go together in certain ways.,Thus to the extent a code base consists of assembling a bunch of UI controls into a view and integrating the view with ActionScript to business logic also written in ActionScript, it should be possible to have that code base leverage Flash-dependent controls in a SWF and leverage HTML-dependent controls without Flash in the browser.,If you right-click on this version, you will see that there is no entry about the Flash Player in the context menu which is proof that it does not use Flash, and you can choose View Source to see the minified JS output from the FlexJS compiler known as FalconJX.
