At the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems this week, Japanese researchers presented a novel idea of how to cool humanoid robots in a much more efficient way: Design them to be able to sweat water straight out of their bones.,Just like with a 3D printer, you get an enormous amount of control over the printing process, and by altering the energy density of the laser during fabrication, you can selectively vary the permeability of the metal that you’re making.  The laser sintering technique is precise enough to build up aluminum structures with areas of both low and high permeability, letting you make seamless metal components that have microchannels embedded in them through which water can flow.,The laser sintering comes in handy here, too, by allowing the water to seep from an inner porous layer into a more porous region near the surface of the frame, from where it can evaporate out into the air.,Testing shows that this method of cooling works three times better than air cooling, and significantly better than just circulating water through the interior channel, although it’s not as effective as a traditional radiator using active cooling.
