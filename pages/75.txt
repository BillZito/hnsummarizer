The bones of 12 or 13 Neanderthals, found in El Sidr√≥n cave in northern Spain, are covered in cut marks associated with butchery.,The latter has historical medicinal uses such as restricting the flow of blood, inducing sweating and even easing toothache, while camomile is known to calm an upset stomach. The team looked at chemical traces on their teeth and found that they had been eating two plants with no nutritional value: camomile and yarrow.,"That's really important, because when you eat plants you have to be able to distinguish between plants that are poisonous and not," says Hardy.,So it has been suggested that other Neanderthals ground up their food for them, and that finding Neanderthals without teeth is evidence that these disabled individuals were cared for.,There are just not enough cases of pre-death tooth loss, they argue, to support the idea that Neanderthals were compassionate individuals who cared for their sick.
