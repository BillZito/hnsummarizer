The freedom of sharing design files for electronic circuits, of working together on these designs in teams avoiding artificial barriers to collaboration, and finally, of not compromising to the use of a sub-optimal design tool.  With this exciting scenario in mind, we decided that KiCad was the best Free and Open Source Software tool to build upon, and we have been contributing to its development ever since.,Among the many CERN contributions, we could highlight the Push & Shove routing engine, the support for differential pairs and track length tuning, and the integration of SPICE simulation into KiCad.
