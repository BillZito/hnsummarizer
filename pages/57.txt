While the hexadecimal notation of using the first six letters of the alphabet is practical in a rough-and-ready sort of way, no one ever accused it of being elegant.,But to this day, the only result I've managed to find in my searches has been a mailing list post in the discussions of The International Slide Rule Group--probably not a very prominent corner of the online world.,Birkana is a Runic symbol set for expressing the hexadecimal number radix, but it's designed in such a way that the exact shape of each number rune is built by combining a basic shape for the number zero and accents which correspond to the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 8.,I find it easiest to sum up starting at the highest possible number, then adding on the next-highest number, and so on.  As you can see, every combination of the zero line and the accents will give us a hexadecimal number .,Notice also the exact positions of the accents--they intersect with the zero line at either the top, middle, or bottom, and they end up parallel to exactly a quarter of the way up or down the zero line.,Theoretically, the Unicode Consortium could decide to add the Birkana symbols to the Unicode specification and some enterprising font designer could come up with a set for general use.
