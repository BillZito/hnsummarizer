When working as a team, however, the chances of coming up with subjective and inaccurate answers are lower, although they are still restricted to the level of knowledge of the members of that team.  Besides, two individuals of the same team can come up with a solution that looks the same for the core of the current issue but is different for edge cases, for better or worse.,If we're aware that the Proper Solution is impossible to be achieved, we can at least try to get as closer as possible to it given the current knowledge or circumstances of an individual or team.
