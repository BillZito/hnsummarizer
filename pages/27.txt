Some time ago the Kde eV had a task to have our old desktops, KDE 1, 2, 3, running in some way to show in the anniversary.  This was an easy job, anyone could do with an old distro and a virtual machine.,There we go, how a 20 years code base of C++ would match against a modern, complete bleeding edge environment ? I started to itch myself and then my first test was Qt 1.45.  I showed that in QtCon and some people even blogged about.,If you want details about the port, how i decided to proceed and what can be done, feel free to contact me by email, on helio@kde.org or on irc on freenode, heliocastro.
