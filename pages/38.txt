The idea, according to freelance investigative journalist François Pilet, is to add some transparency to what he describes as "a very secret world." Pilet acknowledges that some of the dictators he tracks may have legitimate reasons for traveling to Geneva — the Swiss city is home to the United Nations and several other international organizations — though they could just as easily be visiting to evade taxes or launder money, as previous reports have shown.,Pilet came up with the idea for GVA Dictator Alert while writing a story about the autocratic leader of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who has been in power for more than 30 years.,There's a large online community of plane spotters who use similar equipment to track planes across the globe — FlightRadar24 is perhaps the most popular resource — so Pilet decided to create a bot that would use this data to automatically flag planes that are publicly registered to authoritarian governments.  Working together with his cousin, former Google engineer Julien Pilet, he developed a tool that scans antenna signals around Geneva every hour, and automatically posts to Twitter whenever a marked plane enters the city's airspace.,He also aims to gather data from private jets, if he can obtain verifiable registration numbers, as well as information on private boats and yachts, which use similar transponder technology to communicate their location.
