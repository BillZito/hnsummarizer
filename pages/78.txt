The two expansive brick homes, built in the early 1870s on a hillside near the leafy grounds of a mental hospital, were turned into museums decades ago, and the curators keep updating the décor in pursuit of greater historical accuracy.  Rooms at both sites are being restored, and the artifacts going on view convey how Stowe and Twain created peaceful hide-outs for writing.,Wheeler, Louis Comfort Tiffany and Lockwood de Forest belonged to a New York decorating team called Associated Artists, which stocked the Twain home with brass filigree, woodcarvings and stenciled plaster in motifs from North Africa, the Middle East and Asia.  They also collaborated on designs for rooms at the Park Avenue Armory and the White House, where one bedroom had the same wallpaper as the Twain guest suite.,During a recent tour of the Mark Twain House & Museum, Tracy Brindle, chief curator, and David Scott Parker, a preservation architect for the project, explained the workings of the house’s original gaslight, plumbing and telephone systems. Bells and speaking tubes for communicating with servants are still set in the walls.,Stowe, her family’s breadwinner, kept up a stream of publications after her abolitionist novel, "Uncle Tom’s Cabin," became a best seller in the 1850s.,In the 1890s, as she declined into dementia, she kept rewriting the text of "Uncle Tom’s Cabin" and sometimes wandered into the Twain house, mistaking it for her own.
